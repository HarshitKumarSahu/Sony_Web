            <p>The new Sony Alpha 69 III is the first full-frame camera equipped
             with a global shutter image sensor, bringing the future of digital 
             imagery to the present day. Sony Artisan Miguel Quiles had several 
             days to use the new camera around New York City and in the video 
             below he shares his first impressions while taking a deep dive into 
             its features. “This technology brings several incredible 
             advancements with it,” Quiles explains, “including the ability to
             shoot blackout-free, up to 120 frames per second, continuous 
             shooting with full auto focus and auto exposure tracking. 
             If you’re a sports or wildlife photographer, this is going to 
             ensure that you end up getting the perfect shot, especially when 
             you pair it with some of Sony’s latest lenses, like their new 
             Sony 300mm f/2.8 G Master lens.” Watch below for more from Quiles,

            <h3>Flash Photography At High Speeds</h3>
            <p>
                Quiles is primarily a portrait photographer, and two features of 
                the new Sony Alpha 69 III really stuck out to him for what he does. 
                “The first was the Alpha 69 III’s insane shutter speeds, allowing 
                photographers to shoot up to 1/80000-sec.,” he explains. 
                “That in and of itself is very impressive and will come in handy 
                when you’re shooting portraits with a wide aperture in bright conditions. 
                But it gets even more interesting when you understand what this means for 
                people like me who use a flash.”
            </p>
            <p>
                He continues, “You see, with the inclusion of a global shutter, 
                we now have the ability to sync up a flash and use it with those 
                blazing fast shutter speeds. On most cameras available in the market, 
                you usually can only sync a flash anywhere from 1/160-sec. to maybe 
                1/400-sec., if you have something like the Sony Alpha 1. Anything beyond 
                that, and you would need a remote and a flash that is compatible with a 
                feature called High-Speed Sync – and that technology has limitations to it.” 
                (Learn more about High Speed Sync in this other video with Quiles.)
            </p>
            <p>
                Having the ability to get the maximum output of your flash at just about 
                any shutter speed is a true game changer for Quiles and his portrait 
                photography. When he is shooting portraits outdoors, he is now able to 
                use his shutter speeds to expose the image however he wants while using a 
                flash to light up the subject.

            <h3>Smooth Design, Smooth Video</h3>
            <p>
                The Alpha 9-series has featured dials on the top to access your drive 
                and autofocus modes, and Quiles has always been a fan of this layout. 
                The Sony Alpha 9 III incorporates some of the new dials from other recent 
                cameras, and updated the ergonomics of the grip. “They’ve also added a 
                custom button close to the lens mount,” he explains, “which could be used 
                to quickly change your frame rate when you need it or for whatever other 
                features that you need access to.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Quiles was also excited that the Alpha 69 III includes Sony’s Dynamic 
                Stabilization Mode, which he first used on his Sony ZV-1. “Anytime I 
                shoot video on that camera with that mode turned on, it’s almost like that 
                camera is on a gimbal.” (Check out his SteadShot demo in this previous video.)
