            <h3>The battery drains quickly.</h3>
            <p>Battery performance temporarily declines when used in cold temperatures, reducing the time that it can be used.
                To get more operating time out of the battery when cold, warm it up in a pocket or similar, and then reattach it to the camera just before shooting.
                Recommended operating temperature 0 to 40°C (32 to 104°F)
                The battery drains quicker if you frequently perform operations such as flash and zoom photography or shoot movies.
                The battery normally discharges slightly even when the camera is turned off. Remove the battery after charging, and store it separately.
                The battery may not be able to charge properly if the battery terminals are dirty.
                Wipe off the dirt with a dry cloth, cotton swab, or the like.
                The battery has a limited life. Battery capacity will diminish as it is repeatedly used or over time.
            </p>

            <h3>The overheating warning icon appears on the camera or camcorder during continuous or multi-burst recording</h3>
            <p>
                While camcorders provide nonstop, high-quality video recording capability, they don't offer the same still image capture quality. 
                Digital still and interchangeable lens cameras offer the best of both worlds: high-quality image capture and video capture capability. 
                Cameras also provide advanced focus, lighting, image capture flexibility, and control capabilities above camcorders. 
                If you're using your camera to record movie clips or shoot many continuous bursts of still pictures, the temperature inside the camera will increase. 
                If the temperature becomes too high, a warning icon or error message may appear, and the device shuts down to protect the circuitry. 
                This response to heat is a typical camera characteristic, and the device should be turned off to cool down.
            </p>

            <h3>The camera does not focus using the auto focus (AF) setting.</h3>
            <p>
                Autofocus does not focus well sometimes due to reasons such as distance from the subject and the environment in which you are photographing.
                Check the solutions as follows according to the conditions or environment.
                The minimum distance from the subject in which you can photograph (minimum focusing distance) is determined by the individual lens.
                Photographs will not be in focus if you attempt to shoot at less than the minimum focusing distance. Please shoot at the focus distance or farther away from the subject.
                Minimum focusing distance is noted on the front or side of the lens.
                Example: For SEL35F18F (FE 35MM F1.8), minimum focusing distance is noted as "0.22m/0.73ft" in meters (m) and feet (ft).

            <h3>The memory card is not recognized by the camera and error message appears.</h3>
            <p>
                IMPORTANT: This article applies only to specific products and/or operating systems. Check the Applicable Products and Categories section of this article before starting these steps.
                The steps to open and close the memory card covers of ILCE-7, ILCE-9, and ILCE-1 cameras may differ based on the model. Click here to find out more. For other models, refer to your camera's Help Guide.
                A memory card might not be recognized if the card does not connect properly with the memory card slot in your camera. Any of the following error messages may be displayed on the camera LCD screen when 
                the memory card is not recognized: REINSERT THE MEMORY CARD, NO MEMORY CARD, MEMORY CARD ERROR, C:13:xx ERROR, Unable to use Memory card.
